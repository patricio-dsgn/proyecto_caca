                <h2>Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome</h2>
                <p>People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
                    typically report that they suffer with abdominal
                    cramps and constipation. In some patients,
                    chronic constipation is interspersed with
                    brief episodes of diarrhoea; while a minority
                    of patients with IBS have only diarrhoea.
                    The presentation of symptoms is usually months
                    or years and commonly patients consult different
                    doctors, without great success, and doing various
                    specialized investigations. It notices a strong
                    correlation of the reported symptoms with stress;
                    indeed diarrhoeal discharges are associated with
                    emotional phenomena. IBS blood is present only
                    if the disease is associated with haemorrhoids.</p>
                <p>Research conducted on irritable bowel syndrome in the 2000s,[13][14] faecal incontinence[15][16][17][18] and the gastrointestinal complications of HIV[19] have used the Bristol scale as a diagnostic tool easy to use, even in research which lasted for 77 months.</p>        
                <p>Historically, this scale of assessment of the faeces has been recommended by the consensus group of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (San Diego, California, US) for the collection of data on functional bowel disease (FBD).</p>
                <p>More recently, according to the latest revision of the Rome III Criteria, six clinical manifestations of IBS can be identified:</p>

                <p>These four identified subtypes correlate with
                    the consistency of the stool, which can be

                    living in Olmsted County Minnesota, in which
                    participants were asked to complete a questionnaire

                <p>The research results (see table) indicate that about 1 in 5 people have a slow transit (type 1 and 2 stools), while 1 in 12 has an accelerated transit (type 5 and 6 stools). Moreover, the nature of the stool is affected by age, sex, body mass index, whether or not they had cholecystectomy and possible psychosomatic components (somatisation); there were no effects from factors such as smoking, alcohol, the level of education, a history of appendectomy or familiarity with gastrointestinal diseases, civil state, or the use of oral contraceptives.</p>

                <h3>Therapeutic evaluation</h3>

                <p>Several investigations correlate the Bristol stool
                    scale in response to medications or therapies,
                    in fact, in one study was also used to titrate
                    the dose more finely than one drug (colestyramine)
                    in subjects with diarrhoea and faecal incontinence.</p>
                <p>In a randomised controlled study,[29] the scale 
                    is used to study the response to two laxatives:
                    Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) and psyllium
                    (Plantago psyllium and other species of
                    the same genus) of 126 male and female patients 
                    for a period of 2 weeks of treatment; failing
                    to show the most rapid response and increased
                    efficiency of the former over the latter. In
                    the study, they were measured as primary outcomes:
                    the number weekly bowel movements, stool consistency
                    according to the types of the Bristol stool scale,
                    time to defecation, the overall effectiveness,
                    the difficulty in defecating and stool consistency.</p>
                <p>From 2010, several studies have used the scale as a
                    diagnostic tool validated for recognition and evaluation
                    of response to various treatments, such as probiotics,
                    moxicombustion, laxatives in the elderly, preparing
                    Ayurvedic poly-phytotherapy filed TLPL/AY, psyllium,
                    mesalazine, methylnaltrexone, and oxycodone/naloxone,
                    or to assess the response to physical activity in athletes. </p>
